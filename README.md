# What's JAVA? 
Java is an object- oriented programming language created by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton , employees of Sun Microsystems , with the support of Bill Joy (co-founder of Sun Microsystems in 1982 ), officially presented onMay 23 , 1995at SunWorld .

Sun was then acquired in 2009 by Oracle , which now owns and maintains Java .

A peculiarity of Java is that software written in this language is compiled to an intermediate binary representation that can be executed in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) disregarding the operating system .

The Java language largely uses the syntax of the C++ language . Nevertheless, Java has been stripped of the most subtle and at the same time confusing C++ concepts , such as pointers and references, or multiple inheritance circumvented by the implementation of interfaces . Likewise, since version 8, the arrival of functional interfaces introduces multiple inheritance (without attribute management) with its advantages and disadvantages such as diamond inheritance . The designers favored the object-oriented approach so that in Java everything is object except typesprimitives ( integers , floating point numbers, etc.) which however have their variants which inherit from the Object object (Integer, Float, ...).

Java makes it possible to develop client-server applications . On the client side, applets are at the origin of the notoriety of the language. It is especially on the server side that Java has established itself in the business world thanks to servlets , the server side of applets, and more recently JSP ( JavaServer Pages ) which can replace PHP , ASP and ASP.NET .

Java gave birth to an operating system ( JavaOS ), development environments ( eclipse / JDK ), virtual machines ( MSJVM  (en) , JRE ) cross-platform application ( JVM ), a declination for mobile devices /embedded ( J2ME ), a GUI design library ( AWT/Swing ), heavyweight applications (Jude, Oracle SQL Worksheet, etc.), web technologies (servlets, applets) and an enterprise version ( J2EE ). The portability of Java bytecode is ensured by theJava virtual machine, and possibly by standard libraries included in a JRE. This virtual machine can interpret the bytecode or compile it on the fly into machine language. Portability is dependent on the quality of porting the JVMs to each OS.
